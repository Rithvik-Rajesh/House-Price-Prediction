**Project: House Price Prediction with Interactive Web Interface**


This project implements a house price prediction model for the Bengaluru area and provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the model.

**Key Features:**

* Predicts house prices based on relevant features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms.
* Leverages a linear regression model trained using scikit-learn (sklearn), pandas, and NumPy libraries.
* Achieves the best prediction accuracy compared to other explored methods like Lasso and decision trees.
* Offers an interactive web interface where users can input property details and receive predicted house prices.

**Technical Stack:**

* Programming Language: Python, JavaScript
* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn (sklearn), pandas, NumPy
* Web Framework : Flask

**Data Source:**

* [Bengaluru House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)

**Project Inspiration:**

* [YouTube video series on house price prediction](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg)

**Further Enhancements:**

* Explore the possibility of integrating more advanced machine learning models.
* Incorporate data visualization tools to explore the relationship between features and house prices.
* Deploy the web application to a live server for wider accessibility.
